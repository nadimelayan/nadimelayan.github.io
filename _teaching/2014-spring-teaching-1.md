- *"Nadim is easily the best GSI I have had. He was always so excited and eager to teach us and even in office hours, when students made connections without his help, he became excited and eager to continue. I always felt comfortable asking him questions because I knew he would explain it however many times it took until I understood the concept. Thank you Nadim!"* **Winter 2023**

- *"Nadim is the best GSI I have had at the University of Michigan. Although attendance for section was not mandatory, I was compelled to go every Friday morning at 8am solely because of Nadim. His abiltiy to condense lecture material in a way that was easy to digest was very helpful and made studying for the exams so much easier."* **Fall 2022**

- *"Nadim has been the best GSI I have encountered here at the university. His exceptional ability to clearly communicate concepts and ideas has been fundamental for my success in this course. He has proven time and time again to know the material with terrific confidence and has never once inadequately answered a single question. Even if I never came to lecture, I feel that going to Nadim's discussion sections would have been more than enough to ace every exam. His natural ability to teach is a gift. I am not sure what GSIs are paid, but if he does not leave the university a millionaire, then the university will have done him a disservice."* **Winter 2022**

- *"Nadim was one of the best GSIs I've had. He really understood the material he was teaching and was able to explain it in multiple ways. I really liked that he wanted to help us understand the course concepts behind the practice problems as opposed to just teaching how to solve the section problems."* **Fall 2021**

- *"Nadim was fantastic! I usually had many questions about the problem set or quiz, and he was able to help with every single one."* **Winter 2021**

- *"Nadim was great. I appreciated how understanding he was about student circumstances and how available he was for questions. I got the sense that he cared whether his students actually understood the material and he went beyond standard expectations for a GSI."* **Fall 2020**

- *"Section with Nadim is where I learned the most Econ this semester. Next was on my own, and third was in lecture. He explained topics we needed to know by drawing graphs and using scenarios and problems to make them make sense. I felt comfortable answering the questions he asked, even when I was unsure. Nadim never made me feel inadequate if I answered something wrong and always sought to explain until I understood the correct answer. Nadim also went above and beyond by holding review sessions on the weekend before exams so that we had more exposure to the material and could ask questions."* **Winter 2019**

- *"Nadim was one of the Best GSI I have had during my time at Michigan. He taught things clearly and was helpful when students had questions! He made discussion sections interesting and always presented the information clearly.
Thanks for all the help and a great semester!"* **Fall 2018**
