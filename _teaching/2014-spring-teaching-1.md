- "Nadim was one of the Best GSI I have had during my time at Michigan. He taught things clearly and was helpful when students had questions! He made discussion sections interesting and always presented the information clearly.
Thanks for all the help and a great semester!" Fall 2018

- "Section with Nadim is where I learned the most Econ this semester. Next was on my own, and third was in lecture. He explained topics we needed to know by drawing graphs and using scenarios and problems to make them make sense. I felt comfortable answering the questions he asked, even when I was unsure. Nadim never made me feel inadequate if I answered something wrong and always sought to explain until I understood the correct answer. Nadim also went above and beyond by holding review sessions on the weekend before exams so that we had more exposure to the material and could ask questions." Winter 2018
