Welcome! 
I am a Ph.D. Candidate in Economics at the <a href="https://lsa.umich.edu/econ/doctoral-program.html" target="_blank"> University of Michigan </a> 

Fields: Macroeconomics and International Economics.

Secondary Field: Labor Economics.

I am on the 2023-2024 Economics job market.

Before moving to Ann Arbor to start the Ph.D. I worked as an intern at the research department of CaixaBank and as a research assistant at IESE Business School in Barcelona.

- **Strategic or scarred? Disparities in college enrollment and dropout response to macroeconomic conditions. [Job Market Paper]**

![](CF1.png)

Recessions might create enduring scars on young individuals, notably during critical periods such as high school graduation and college enrollment. I investigate how educational choices amplify or mitigate these scarring effects across income levels. Low-income individuals face dual impacts from recession scars: increased likelihood of dropping out while enrolled, and enduring negative labor market entry effects. Conversely, high-income individuals strategically evade these repercussions, delaying labor market entry through timely college enrollment during economic downturns. Employing a dynamic model, I quantify the lifetime repercussions of experiencing a recession during these critical phases. The poorest individuals endure a 39% reduction in lifetime utility if a recession occurs while they are enrolled in college. A recession that occurs around the time of high school graduation predominantly affects the middle-low income group, hindering their college attendance, resulting in a 19% lifetime utility loss. High-income individuals exhibit resilience to these economic fluctuations.

- **State dependent Okun's law: A selective labor hoarding approach**

![](Statedependent.png)

In this paper I show that Okun's Law, the relationship between changes in the unemployment rate and real GDP, is state dependent: the relationship is stronger during recessions. I hypothesis that firms engaging in selective labor hoarding can explain this state dependency. If firms hoard high-skilled workers outside of recessions to economize on training costs Okun's law will be relatively flat in those times. Such labor hoarding becomes untenable during recessions, which results in a nonlinear response of unemployment. I build a dynamic model of directed search with heterogeneous firms, endogenous exit and training costs that is able to generate the nonlinear response of unemployment to changes in real GDP.

- **Global value chains and regional shocks** *with José Ramón Morán van Gelderen*

How are Global Value Chains affected by the presence of regional economic shocks? In particular, how do firms form their GVCs when exposed to regional economic shocks that affect the probability of delivery from their suppliers? In this paper we propose a theoretical framework for how firms optimally form their GVCs. Firms will trade off between having countries with diverse specialization patterns to better exploit gains from comparative advantage and having countries that experience synchronous shock patterns because firms rely on members of their GVCs to deliver all necessary inputs on time. We use Mexican customs data on input purchases at the firm level to test the existence of this theoretical tradeoff.
